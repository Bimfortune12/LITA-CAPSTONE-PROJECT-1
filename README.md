* SQL: Structured Query Language for Querying Data
* POwer BI

### Data cleaning and Preparation
In the phase of Data cleaning and preparation was done by the following.
* Data loading and Inspecttion
* Handling missing variation
* cleaning formating and deleting all the duplicate found

### Exploratory Data Analysis
